## Introduction
This codebase is created to build benchmarks for object detection on DIOR.
It is modified from [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3 to 1.6**.
The old v1.x branch works with PyTorch 1.1 to 1.4, but v2.0 is strongly recommended for faster speed, higher performance, better design and more friendly usage.


### Major features
we do have no extra data augmentation tricksï¼Œthis repo follows the original features in [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). 






## License

This project is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Changelog

v2.7.0 was released in 30/11/2020.
Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) for details and release history.
A comparison between v1.x and v2.0 codebases can be found in [compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).

## Benchmark and model zoo

- Results are available in the [Model zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).
- You can find the detailed configs in configs/DIOR.



## Installation

Please refer to [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for installation.

## Getting Started

Please see [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for the basic usage of DIORDetection.
We provide [colab tutorial](demo/MMDet_Tutorial.ipynb), and full guidance for quick run [with existing dataset](docs/1_exist_data_model.md) and [with new dataset](docs/2_new_data_model.md) for beginners.
There are also tutorials for [finetuning models](docs/tutorials/finetune.md), [adding new dataset](docs/tutorials/new_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), [customizing models](docs/tutorials/customize_models.md), [customizing runtime settings](docs/tutorials/customize_runtime.md) and [useful tools](docs/useful_tools.md).

Please refer to [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for frequently asked questions.
