            positive bbox. Positive samples can have smaller IoU than
            pos_iou_thr due to the 4th step (assign max IoU sample to each gt).
        gt_max_assign_all (bool): Whether to assign all bboxes with the same
            highest overlap with some gt to that gt.
        ignore_iof_thr (float): IoF threshold for ignoring bboxes (if
            `gt_bboxes_ignore` is specified). Negative values mean not
            ignoring any bboxes.

            `bboxes` and `gt_bboxes_ignore`, or the contrary.
        gpu_assign_thr (int): The upper bound of the number of GT for GPU
            assign. When the number of gt is above this threshold, will assign
            on CPU device. Negative values mean not assign on CPU.
